Preface

Network management systems are nowadays among the most essential elements of a successfully
functioning computer network. The maintenance and configuration of network devices, servers and services
are the key parameters of a network management system. To ensure the reliable and secure management of
devices and services, it is necessary to design a network in such a manner that it provides the highest level
of security isolation of management traffic from production traffic. Another aspect of the successful
management of computer network concerns the network protocols used for this purpose, as well as their
implementation i.e. the way they are used.
Frog Cellsat NMS provides real-time network management tool which can monitor the repeater network
24X7 and provide alerts. It is developed in compliance with FCAPS (an ISO Telecommunication
Management Network model & framework for network management) the system embraces fault,
configuration, administration, performance & security management features.
With the capability to remotely monitor and control, the system enables easier diagnosis and
troubleshooting activities. Repeater parameters such as UL and DL gain setting and band tunability can be
controlled remotely. The architecture leads to easy maintenance and availability management. NMS is
easily deployable, customizable and scalable.

Introduction to GPRS NMS

                                                                                                         7|Page
 1.1 Framework of GPRS NMS

GPRS NMS is an easy-to-use web-based application that allows users to supervise the repeater
performance inside a bigger network management framework. It assists with network device
discovery, network device monitoring and intelligent notifications (synthesizer alarm/electricity
alarm). It usually records data from a network's remote points to carry out central reporting to a
system administrator.
The key benefit to NMS is that it permits users to monitor or manage the repeater performance
using a single server. Thus, it is not only a cost effective but also an improved and productive
solution.

 1.2 Architecture of GPRS NMS

Repeater Access through NMS
Network Management System (NMS) is a GPRS based application. So, to ascertain the repeater
performance, both NMS server and repeater should have internet access. Repeaters get internet
connectivity through SIM Module. As soon as the GPRS activated SIM is inserted in the repeater,
it gets automatically connected to internet & a dynamic IP is created. Now, these repeaters start to
send an encrypted data (like repeater id, location etc.) to NMS Server on a dedicated IP/Port
(TCP Port-1001) on TCP/IP enabled platform.

                                                      Figure 1 Repeater Access through NMS

Whenever any information is required, NMS server connects with repeater on TCP/IP connection,
fetches the information and displays on the internal webpage on https Protocol.

                                                                                                                  8|Page
Access Point Name (APN): An Access Point Name (APN) is a gateway between a GSM, GPRS,
3G or 4G mobile network and another computer network, frequently the public Internet. A mobile
device making a data connection must be configured with an APN to present to the carrier.
Frog Cellsat Ltd. needs client’s standard APN to make out the repeater performance incessantly
through NMS. Even as the client provides the standard APN, our company sets up the APN details
at the repeater level and when the SIM (provided by the clients) is inserted in the repeater, it will
be automatically connected to internet. The APN details will be programmed within the repeater,
a customized APN can also be deployed which will work only with repeater firmware and hence
be more secure.

Repeater Connectivity to network
As the data traffic arises at the repeater, it goes to base transceiver station over the air. Then, the
BTS facilitates the wireless communication between user equipment and networks in control of
Base station controller. BSC is responsible for the allocation of radio resources to a mobile call
and for the handovers that are made between base stations under its control.
The PCU or Packet Control Unit is a hardware router that is added to the BSC. It differentiates
data destined for the standard GSM network (circuit switched data) and for the GPRS network
(Packet Switched Data).

                                                    Figure 2 Repeater Connectivity to network

MSC: A mobile switching center (MSC) is the centerpiece of a network switching subsystem
(NSS). The MSC is mostly associated with communication switching functions, such as call set-
up, release, and routing. However, it also performs a host of other duties, including routing.
SMS messages, conference calls, fax, and service billing as well as interfacing with other
networks, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
The MSC is structured so that base stations connect to it, while it connects to the PSTN. Because
cellphones connect to these base stations, all forms of communication, whether between two cell
phones or between a cell phone and a landline telephone, travel through the MSC.

                                                                                                                  9|Page
A small network operator may employ only one MSC, while a large operator requires multiple
MSCs. The MSC plays a significant role in handovers, particularly handovers involving multiple
base station controllers - known as inter-BSC or intra-MSC handovers - as well as those involving
multiple MSCs, known as inter-MSC handovers.
GSN: GPRS Support Node (GSN) is a network node which supports the use of GPRS in the GSM
core network. All GSNs should have a Gn interface and support the GPRS tunneling protocol.
There are two key variants of the GSN, namely SGSN and GGSN.
SGSN: Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) performs the same function as Mobile Switching
Centre (MSC) does for voice traffic. It forms the gateway within the network and provides a variety
of services to the mobiles:

    • Packet routing and transfer
    • Mobility management
    • Attach/detach
    • Authentication
There is a location register within the SGSN and it stores location information (e.g., current cell,
current VLR). It also stores the user profiles (e.g., IMEI, packet addresses used) for all the GPRS
users registered with the SGSN.
GGSN: Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) forms the gateway to the outside world. It can be
a combination of a gateway, router and firewall as it hides the internal network to the outside. In
operation, when the GGSN receives data addressed to a specific user, it checks if the user is active,
then forwarding the data. In the opposite direction, packet data from the mobile is routed to the
right destination network by the GGSN.

 1.3 NMS Data Polling

Network Management System (NMS) uses the data polling to gather the repeater status
continually. GPRS NMS Data can be achieved via URL Polling.

                                                                                                                 10 | P a g e
                                                              Figure 3 NMS Data Polling

URL Polling: In URL Polling, the service engineer can login the internal URL in the format of
aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd:zzzz (aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd represents the static IP and zzzz states the port
number) on the web page & can fetch information of the status of any circle network as well as
individual repeater.

 1.4 NMS Alarm Communication

As the repeater will ping the NMS server over TCP/IP Protocol, the repeater condition will be
updated at the NMS server. And if there is a panic condition, the repeater will generate a specific
alarm (Synthesizer fail alarm/Power alarm/Electricity alarm/Status) using SNMP (Simple
Network Management Protocol) and send it to the NMS Server.
Then, the user will keep a watch on the received alarms and will rectify the issues through the
remote monitoring system.

? NMS Alarms

    NMS will offer provision for alarms in multple situation as stated below:
    ? Synthesizer fail alarm- When the repeater will not generate a required local oscillator

         frequency, no signal can be amplified. Then the repeater will manifest a FAIL status on
         NMS, Otherwise PASS status will be shown on it.
    ? Power alarm- This alarm indicates the power level for uplink and downlink (High/Low).
    ? Electricity alarm- When the electricity supply of repeater goes down, this alarm will

                                                                                                                 11 | P a g e
         generate and show FAIL status of Electricity Alarm on NMS, otherwise OK.
    ? Status-This alarm will show repeater connectivity to the NMS and the updated time

         when NMS had fetched the data from repeater last time. If the repeater is connected then
         YES will be shown in connected column.

                                                           Figure 4 Alarm Communication

Please Note: If any band (GSM/DCS1/DCS2/UMTS) is not present in the repeater, then NMS
will show NA(Not Available) for that band.

                                                                                                                 12 | P a g e

  2.1 NMS Access

  To access the GPRS NMS, every user should have a URL (static IP) provided by Frog Cellsat.
  URL acts as an interface between user and the web-based application. It contains the name of
  the protocol to be used to access the resource and a resource name. The first part of a URL
  identifies what protocol to use. The second part identifies the IP address or domain name where
  the resource is located. Without URL, no one can access the GPRS NMS web page.
  User can configure the repeater parameters only after login his NMS account through GPRS-NMS
  connectivity.

  2.2 NMS Authentication

 NMS Authentication

  NMS is a web-based application and it is authenticated for 3 types of users:
• Monitor User
• Admin User
• Super User
